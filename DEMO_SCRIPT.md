# üé¨ Sailo MVP Demo Script

## üéØ The Problem (30 seconds)

"Imagine you're a startup with a growing database. You know there's valuable signals in your data, but building monitoring pipelines takes weeks and costs thousands. What if you could turn any database table into a smart monitoring system in just 3 clicks?"

## üöÄ The Solution - Live Demo (90 seconds)

### Setup

- Browser open to `http://localhost:5173`
- "MVP Demo" tab selected
- Goal already filled: "watch for spikes in options volume and alert the team"
- Slack webhook URL ready (optional)

### Step 1: Inspect (15 seconds)

**[Click "üîç 1. Inspect Database"]**

> "First, our AI inspects the database. It's looking at our options trading table..."

**[Wait for results to load]**

> "Perfect! It found 20+ records with 24 columns. It automatically identified numeric columns like volume, premium, strike price, and datetime columns like trade timestamps. No manual schema definition needed."

### Step 2: Auto-Plan (20 seconds)

**[Click "ü§ñ 2. Auto-Plan Pipeline"]**

> "Now the AI creates a monitoring plan based on our goal. It's deciding which metrics to monitor, what thresholds make sense, and how to structure the alerts..."

**[Wait for plan to generate]**

> "Incredible! It chose to monitor 'volume' as the key metric, selected 'trade_timestamp' for time series analysis, and configured it to run every 15 minutes with Slack alerts. The AI made all these decisions automatically."

### Step 3: Run Once (30 seconds)

**[Click "‚ö° 3. Run Once"]**

> "Now let's run the pipeline. The AI is analyzing our options data for anomalies..."

**[Wait for analysis - point out the loading states]**

> "And there we have it! The AI found 3 anomalies in our options data:"

**[Read through the results]**

- "High volume spike in AAPL calls - 25,000 contracts, way above normal"
- "SQUEEZE calls showing gamma squeeze conditions"
- "Unusual volatility patterns in MEME options"

> "Each alert includes specific values, severity levels, and recommended actions. If we had a Slack webhook configured, this would already be in our team channel."

### Recap (25 seconds)

> "In 3 clicks, we went from raw database to intelligent monitoring:
>
> 1. AI inspected our schema automatically
> 2. Generated a smart monitoring plan
> 3. Analyzed data and found actionable insights
>
> What used to take weeks of ETL development now takes 30 seconds."

## üèóÔ∏è The Technology Behind It (30 seconds)

> "This runs entirely on Modal's serverless platform:
>
> - Llama 3.2 for AI analysis (no OpenAI costs!)
> - Auto-scaling from 0 to 1000+ concurrent functions
> - Pay-per-use pricing (10x cheaper than traditional infrastructure)
> - Built-in reliability with fallback plans
>
> We've democratized AI monitoring - no ML expertise required."

## üéØ The Vision (15 seconds)

> "Today you saw Postgres ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Slack. Tomorrow: multiple data sources, complex multi-step pipelines, custom actions, all with zero ops. We're making enterprise-grade monitoring accessible to every team."

## üé™ Demo Tips

### Before the Demo:

1. ‚úÖ Test all endpoints with `python test_mvp_endpoints.py`
2. ‚úÖ Verify web app loads correctly
3. ‚úÖ Have backup plan ready if live demo fails
4. ‚úÖ Practice timing - aim for 2 minutes total

### During the Demo:

- **Keep moving**: Don't wait for every detail to load
- **Narrate actively**: Explain what the AI is doing while it works
- **Show, don't tell**: Let the interface speak for itself
- **Handle failures gracefully**: If something breaks, pivot to the backup

### Key Messages:

1. **3 clicks**: Emphasize the simplicity
2. **AI-powered**: The intelligence that makes it work
3. **Serverless**: The infrastructure advantage
4. **Zero ops**: The maintenance benefit

### Backup Plan:

If live demo fails, show these screenshots:

- Inspection results JSON
- Auto-generated plan
- Analysis with anomalies found
- Slack message example

## üèÜ Competition Angles

### vs Traditional ETL:

- **Time**: 3 clicks vs 3 weeks
- **Cost**: $10/month vs $500/month
- **Expertise**: No ML knowledge vs data science team
- **Maintenance**: Zero vs constant updates

### vs Other Monitoring Tools:

- **AI-native**: Decisions made by AI, not rules
- **Database-agnostic**: Works with any SQL database
- **Serverless-first**: Built for modern infrastructure
- **Developer-friendly**: API-first, no complex UIs

---

**Remember: The goal is to show the magic of turning data into action in seconds, not minutes or weeks.**
